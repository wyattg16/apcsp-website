  <h1>All about Maggie Tran</h1>
  <h2>The basics</h2>

  <p>I am currently a junior at Canyon Crest Academy. I am also currently enrolled in AP Computer Science and that is why I am coding this website right now. I work at Kumon and I am a tutor for kids;I enjoy it very much because I want to be a pediatrician. I did not know any coding back in January but look at me now coding with html.</p>

  <h2>My aspirations</h2>
  <p>I hope to go to school at Northwestern Univeristy and participate in the 7 year medical program. It will be very difficult but a girl can dream.</p>
