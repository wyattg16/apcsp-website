	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>School</h2>
		<p>
		"I will be attending Boston University in the fall and will be studying Finance in the Questrom School of Business"
		</p>
	<h2>Sports</h2>
		<p>
		"I consider my sport to be gymnastics because I competed for 10 years, and I got all the way up to level 8 before I quit: or as I like to call it retiring. The reason I quit is because I had a back injury that prohibited me from doing most of the events that I competed on. My last goal was to make it to state, which I did, and then I would put down my grips and leave. Happily I still am involved with the gymnstics center because I work there as a coach for recreation kids."
		</p>
	<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>
		"My current job is a gymnastics coach for kids at the gym where I competed. I work fridays and teach different kids how to do simple things like forward rolls and handstands. I enjoy my job because I can sometimes see myself in the little kids; also I like being back in the gymnastics center."
		</p>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
		"I currently have a DJI Phantom 3 standard quadcopter, it can take really cool photos and videos from a perspective that you don't normally see in day to day life. Another thing that I like to do with my friends is to go paintballing, I own my own paintball gun and it is fun to go and play tournament games."
